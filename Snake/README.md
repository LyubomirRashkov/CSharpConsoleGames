##  :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: Welcome to Snake  :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

This is the old Snake game! Who didn't play it? :grinning:

In this version there are:
  + two different kinds of food;
  + a counter for the points (different kinds of food give different amount of points);
  + a counter for the level (to reach the next level you have to achieve 10 points);
  + every time when the snake eats a piece of food a new brick will appear on a random position;
  + the food will disappear after some period of time and will appear on a new position, so be quick.

Be careful because the snake moves twice faster in vertical direction.
