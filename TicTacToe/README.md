##  :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: Welcome to TicTacToe 1.0  :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

In this version of the game you have the opportunity to choose against who you want to play - a friend or the computer.

If you choose to play against the computer there are three difficulty levels - easy, medium or hard.

What do you think - can you win against the computer when the difficulty level is set to hard?  	:smirk:
